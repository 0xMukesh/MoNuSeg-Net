# MoNuSeg-Net

An U-Net based model enhanced with attention + residual + squeeze-and-excitation blocks (SE-Attn-ResU-Net) for multi-organ nuclei segmentation. It is trained and evaluated on [MoNuSAC 2020](https://monusac-2020.grand-challenge.org/) dataset.

### Future work

- [ ] Using EfficientNet-like model as encoder backbone
- [ ] Dense skip connections like U-Net++
- [ ] Train it on other nuclei segmentation related datasets like PanNuke
- [ ] Incoprating cross-validation and ensembling
